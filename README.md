# DOCX2PNG

I couldn't find a good docx-png converter so I made one.

It works very slowly because it is deployed on a server with half a gigabyte of RAM, but nevertheless: <https://docx2png.shoggothstaring.com/>

## Details

Ask Google Gemini for details, it wrote the project.

I mean I chose the architecture and looked at the code but did not write a single line of code here. The project is fully vibe-coded **and deployed** by Gemini CLI.
